\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 Assignment 5: Software Design\
\

\b0 This is a software design for a Reminders application and this will show you how the structure of the application looks. What the application will provide and what type of functionality the function will provide. For example, some functionality it provides is that the user is able to reminders and for each reminder have a date and time associated with that certain reminder. These reminders can be deleted after the reminder has been done or it can be marked checked as done or marked unchecked if the user wants the application to remind itself to do it again.}
